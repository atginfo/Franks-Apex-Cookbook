This repository will store any reusable solutions based on previous project work I have developed

During my project work I have worked with Salesforce CPQ to customize different aspects of the experience for clients. I will be continuously updating this repository with solutions I have worked on to be Salesforce CPQ agnostic. If any custom metadata needs to be created for the solution, I will call it out in each solution's README.

Thank you and Happy Coding!

## Work includes:
- Custom Dyamic Templates for Quote Documents
- Custom Product Selection process for QLE (WIP)
- Ability to export Quote Lines for any Quote (WIP)
- Ability to override default Add Products page for Opportunity (WIP)
